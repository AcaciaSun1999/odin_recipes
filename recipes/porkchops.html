    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This easy pork chop recipe is always a hit at family gatherings. A mixture of soy, ginger, brown sugar, and garlic adds plenty of sweet umami flavor since it's used as both a marinade and a basting sauce.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 boneless pork chops</li>
        <li>1/2 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pierce pork chops on both sides with a fork.</li>
        <li>Whisk soy sauce, brown sugar, lemon juice, oil, ginger, and garlic powder together in a bowl. Reserve about 1/4 cup marinade for basting; pour remaining marinage into a resealable plastic bag. Add pork chops to the bag, coat with marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 6 to 8 hours.</li>
        <li>When ready to cook, preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. Remove pork chops from marinade and shake off excess. Discard remaining marinade.</li>
        <li>Cook pork chops on the preheated grill, basting often with the reserved marinade, until no longer pink in the center, 6 to 8 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).</li>
    </ol>
